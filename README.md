# Percolation Project

## Overview

The Percolation project is designed to simulate percolation processes on an n-by-n grid. It consists of two main classes:

- **Percolation**: This class models a percolation system, allowing you to open sites, check their status, and determine percolation.
- **PercolationStats**: Use this class to perform statistical analysis on percolation trials, calculating key metrics.

The project leverages the Weighted Quick Union-Find algorithm for efficient union and connected operations, making it a valuable tool for studying percolation behavior and conducting statistical analysis.

## Usage

To use this project, explore the following classes and methods:

- **Percolation Class**: Simulate percolation systems, open sites, check site status, and analyze percolation.

- **PercolationStats Class**: Perform statistical analysis on multiple trials, calculating the sample mean, sample standard deviation, and confidence intervals.
